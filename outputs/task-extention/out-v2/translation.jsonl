{"sequences": ["Clock-dependent probabilistic timed automata extend classical timed automata with discrete probabilistic choice, where the probabilities are allowed to depend on the exact values of the clocks. Previous work has shown that the quantitative reachability problem for clock-dependent probabilistic timed automata with at least three clocks is undecidable. In this paper, we consider the subclass of clock-dependent probabilistic timed automata that have one clock , that have clock dependencies described by affine functions, and that satisfy an initialisation condition requiring that, at some point between taking edges with non-trivial clock dependencies, the clock must have an integer value. We present an approach for solving in polynomial time quantitative and qualitative reachability problems of such one-clock initialised clock-dependent probabilistic timed automata.

{"sequences": ["All of the Yelp reviews about this place are spot on. Our group of 6, both males and females, truly enjoyed this cigar bar. The staff in the humidor were very helpful by guiding us with our cigar purchase. We got a table outside, enjoyed tangerine mojitos and other drinks while smoking a cigar and watching the FloridaLSU game. It was so relaxing and truly a highlight of our Vegas trip. Although it is in the Forum Shops, it seems like a little oasis where you can sit back, relax and people watch while enjoying a drink. I highly recommend this place, especially with a group of friends.
